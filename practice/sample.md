# This is the header
- Here is a bullet point about something cool
Now I will write a full sentence to see what it will look like when I write my essay. I am going to go on long enough so that this paragraph spans multiple lines because I am curious about what that will look like.

Now I will demonstrate a line <br>

To save
==========

You type CTRL+D (I included an extra line after the second header here, did it make a difference?)

I am now back in terminal and typing more stuff. I used the command cat>>sample.md again and it doesn't show me old text but I can type again. Hopefully this means I add on to what's there rather than replace it.
I just hit enter once. Is there a line break?

What about now? I did enter twice.

*look at this!*

> It's a block quote!
>> "And this is a regular quote inside a block quote inside a block quote!"

*italics?* **bold??**

OK now I will attempt going back and editing a previous line! Here is a secret word: carrot. If this was successful, it will be gone.

**NOT POSSIBLE**
==================
- I need to use a text editor like nano (according to chat) so the secret's out!
